- Developed an Android app that estimates the value of old vehicles like bikes, cars, trucks, and buses. 
- Users provide details such as category, brand, model, trim name, owner, and fuel type, and the app calculates the vehicle's price in three conditions: bad, good, and excellent. 
- This allows users to determine the price based on their vehicle's condition. 
- To ensure accuracy, We tested the app using a dataset of over 5000 data points.

Technology Used - Java Springboot, Hibernate, MySQL and AWS.
